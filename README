Description:  	Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This is located on GitHub at: https://github.com/tlepage/rpn-calculator

I conformed to the Ruby style guide located at:  
	https://github.com/styleguide/ruby

#### Specifications

1. The calculator should use standard input and standard output, unless the
   language makes that impossible.

2. It should implement the four standard arithmetic operators.

3. It should support negative and decimal numbers, and should not have
   arbitrary limits on the number of operations.

4. The calculator should not allow invalid or undefined behavior.

5. The calculator should exit when it receives a `q` command or an end of input 
   indicator (EOF).
   
In addition to the above specs, I also provided the following key commands:

 - 's':  This will show the current items in the buffer so that the user
         can easily see what they've input so far
         
 - 'c':  This will clear the calculator buffer
 ####
 
 I included functional tests in the /tests folder ("test_rpn_calculator.rb")
 and validated that all of the tests pass.  If you'd like to run the tests,
 on the command line, navigate to the top-level directory and type 'rake test'.
 
 Here's the latest output from running my tests:
